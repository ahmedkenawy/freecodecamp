            <li><b>Contributions</b>Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography established the basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry</li>
            <li><b>Algebra</b>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</li>
            <li><b>Arithmetic</b>-Khwārizmī's second major work was on the subject of arithmetic, which survived in a Latin translation but was lost in the original Arabic. The translation was most likely done in the 12th century by Adelard of Bath, who had also translated the astronomical tables in 1126.</li>
            <li><b>Astronomy</b>Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind[11] (Arabic: زيج السند هند‎, "astronomical tables of Sindh and Hind") is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. This is the first of many Arabic Zijes based on the Indian astronomical methods known as the sindhind</li>
            <li><b>Trigonometry</b>Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind also contained tables for the trigonometric functions of sines and cosine.[22] A related treatise on spherical trigonometry is also attributed to him.</li>
            <li><b>Geography</b>Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ (Arabic: كتاب صورة الأرض‎, "Book of the Description of the Earth"),</li>
