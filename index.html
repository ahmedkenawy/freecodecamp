            <li><b>Astronomy</b>Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind[11] (Arabic: زيج السند هند‎, "astronomical tables of Sindh and Hind") is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of sine values. This is the first of many Arabic Zijes based on the Indian astronomical methods known as the sindhind</li>
            <li><b>Trigonometry</b>Al-Khwārizmī's Zīj al-Sindhind also contained tables for the trigonometric functions of sines and cosine.[22] A related treatise on spherical trigonometry is also attributed to him.</li>
            <li><b>Geography</b>Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ (Arabic: كتاب صورة الأرض‎, "Book of the Description of the Earth"),</li>
